                Here, architecture is freed from the constraints of the real world, from the calculation of forces, <br>
                from the scarcity of materials. The absence of technical and physical constraints allowed us to <br> 
                concentrate on aesthetic and purely formal research. Between dream and reality, the Elektra <br>
                Virtual Museum and its programming are constantly reinvented.
